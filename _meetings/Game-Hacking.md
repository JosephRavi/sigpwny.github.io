# Game Hacking
This meeting is about hacking games. We will be using an FPS Game to demonstrate so bring your **mouse** in order to make playing the game easier! Make sure to download Cheat Engine for this meeting. Mac can be a bit tricky to set everything up on â€” you need to disable "System Integrity Protection". If you can do so, set a Windows VM, or pair up with someone who has a Windows laptop handy. If none of those options are available, there are CTF problems that do not require Cheat Engine you can work on.
