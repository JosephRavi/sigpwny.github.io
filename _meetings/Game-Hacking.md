# Game Hacking
This meeting is about hacking games. We will be using an FPS Game to demonstrate so bring your **mouse** in order to make playing the game easier! Make sure to download Cheat Engine for this meeting. It is much easier with Windows than Mac. If you are having trouble installing it on your Mac, you can set a Windows VM. Otherwise, you can always pair up with someone using a Windows computer. If none of those options are available, there are CTF problems that do not require Cheat Engine you can work on.
